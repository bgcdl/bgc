##, what is BGC
BGC is a "technology+smart+finance" distributed network that uses blockchain technology and digital identities to digitize assets and uses smart contracts to automatically manage, trade, and circulate digital assets.
##, digital assets
Digital assets are programmable assets that exist in the form of electronic data. The use of blockchain technology to realize asset digitization has features such as decentralization, mediation, trust-free, traceability, and high transparency. The BGC supports multiple digital assets at the bottom level. Users can register their assets on the BGC, freely trade and transfer, and resolve mapping relationships with physical assets through digital identities.
##, digital identity
Digital identity refers to the identity information of individuals, organizations, and things that exist in the form of electronic data. The current mature digital identity system is based on the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) X.509 standard. In BGC, we will implement a set of X.509-compliant digital identity standards. This set of digital identity standards, in addition to the X.509-compliant hierarchical certificate issuance model, will also support the Web Of Trust peer-to-peer certificate issuance model. At the same time, the blockchain will be used in place of the OCSP protocol to manage and record X.509's list of revoked certificate CRLs.
##, smart contract
The smart contract was first proposed by cryptographer Nick Szabo in 1994 and is almost the same age as the Internet. According to Nick Szabo's definition: When a pre-programmed condition is triggered, the smart contract executes the corresponding contract terms. Blockchain technology has brought us a decentralized, irreproducible, and highly reliable system. In this environment, smart contracts can come in handy. BGC has an independent smart contract system: BGContract.
The most important feature of the BGContract smart contract system is the seamless integration with the existing developer ecosystem. Developers can develop, debug, and compile smart contracts in a familiar IDE environment (Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.) without learning a new programming language, using mainstream programming languages ​​such as C# and Java. BGC's general-purpose lightweight virtual machine BGVM is highly deterministic, highly concurr- ent, and highly scalable. The BGContract smart contract system enables millions of developers worldwide to quickly develop smart contracts.
